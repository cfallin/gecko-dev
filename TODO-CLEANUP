- Split out easily separable pieces onto new stack:
  - shell wizer base
  - AOT ICs
  - new PBL header (non-weval version) and refactors to use it
  - CacheIR ops (PBL interpreter body updates)
  - weval header and integration
  - PR this

- weval release to npm

- PR to spidermonkey-wasi-embedding to build weval variant, build weval pre-cache

- PR to starlingmonkey to run weval during build instead of wizer
