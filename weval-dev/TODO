- weval
  X get specialized/generic-bailout architecture working
    - add a config option to test it
  X add intrinsics for memory-constantness and for interpreter loop
  X add specialization requests at call-points
  X add specialization requests when creating JSScripts (and put the weval state
    in JSScript instead of JitScript)
  X get Octane passing
  - === milestone 1: weval of JSOp loop
  X add pointers on ICStubs for specialized funcs
  X add weval intrinsics to IC loop
  X add CacheIRWriter bodies for common ICs (find a way to collect these: print
    in CacheIRWriter?)
  - === milestone 2: weval'd IC stubs
  X add stack-renaming and renaming for icregs
  - ensure that IC invocation code is minimized (put error-case switch off the
    critical path, ensure it's not in PC-specialized code)
  - No hybrid ICs in specialized bodies? (Collect common ICs for this too)
  - Replace OOL stuff with unified template-specialized code
  - === milestone 3: opts

- PBL
  - async resume (v2 -- fix perf regression)
  - constructor-call fastpath (Jamey)
  - all IC ops (Jamey)
