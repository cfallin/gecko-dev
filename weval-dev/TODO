- weval
  X get specialized/generic-bailout architecture working
    - add a config option to test it
  X add intrinsics for memory-constantness and for interpreter loop
  X add specialization requests at call-points
  X add specialization requests when creating JSScripts (and put the weval state
    in JSScript instead of JitScript)
  - get Octane passing
  - === milestone 1: weval of JSOp loop
  - add pointers on ICStubs for specialized funcs
  - add weval intrinsics to IC loop
  - add CacheIRWriter bodies for common ICs (find a way to collect these: print
    in CacheIRWriter?)
  - === milestone 2: weval'd IC stubs
  - add stack-renaming and renaming for icregs
  - ensure that IC invocation code is minimized (put error-case switch off the
    critical path, ensure it's not in PC-specialized code)
  - === milestone 3: opts

- perf regression from 3.3.0 to 3.3.1 (Jake)
  - from async resume in PBL?
